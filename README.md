ReadMe - Ubuntu File Manager
============================

Ubuntu File Manager App is the official file manager app for Ubuntu Touch. We follow an open
source model where the code is available to anyone to branch and hack on. The
ubuntu file manager app originally followed a test driven development (TDD) where tests were
written in parallel to feature implementation to help spot regressions easier.
